# TodoList-Java-Project
Personal Project using Java with some Java packages(Calendar, JSON, Junit, etc) to construnct a TodoList which could edit and store the importance, duedate and description of the task.
Todo List Application is a simple application that operated on both Windows and Mac OS, provides users with wonderful task management experience with its clean, beautiful, simplified, and user-friend GUI.
This Todo List application was the first personal programming project I have ever completed. The idea of having my own todolist application came to my mind after I completed my first university software construction course and I realized none of the task management software out there really meet my needs. If anyone is interested in trying out this app, you are more than welcome to visit my GitHub site to download it from the repository : )
